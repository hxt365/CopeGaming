END USER LICENSE AGREEMENT

PLEASE READ THIS LICENSE CAREFULLY BEFORE USING THIS 
SOFTWARE.  By using this software, you are agreeing to be bound by all terms 
of this License.  If you do not agree to the terms of this License, promptly return 
the unopened software and its complete packaging for a full refund.


LICENSE.

In consideration of payment of the License fee, which is a portion of the price 
you paid, the software, including any images incorporated in or generated by the 
software, and data accompanying this License (the "Software") and related 
documentation are licensed (not sold) to you by Disney Interactive, Inc. 
("Disney").  Disney does not transfer title to the Software to you;  this License 
shall not be considered a "sale" of the Software.  You own the CD ROM on 
which the Software is recorded, but Disney retains full and complete title to the 
Software on the CD ROM and the accompanying documentation, and all 
intellectual and industrial property rights therein.  This non-exclusive and 
personal License gives you the right to use and display this copy of the Software.  
You must treat the Software like any other copyrighted material except that you 
may either (a) make one copy of the Software solely for backup or archival 
purposes, or (b) install and use the Software on the hard disk drive of a single 
computer provided you keep the original solely for backup or archival purposes.  
You may not copy the written material accompanying the Software.


RESTRICTIONS. 

The Software contains copyrighted material, trade secrets, and other proprietary 
material.  You may not re-sell, decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble or 
otherwise reduce the Software to a human-perceivable form.  Except as provided 
for in this License, you may not copy, modify, network, rent, lease, or otherwise 
distribute the Software;  nor can you make the Software available by "bulletin 
boards," on-line services, remote dial-in, or network or telecommunications links 
of any kind;  nor can you create derivative works or any other works that are 
based upon or derived from the Software in whole or in part.  Within the terms 
of this License agreement, you may transfer all of the license rights to the 
Software to another party, provided that the original CD ROM containing the 
Software, the related documentation, all copyright notices, and a copy of this 
License are transferred to that party, and provided that party reads and agrees to 
accept the terms and conditions of this License.  If you transfer the Software, you 
must remove the Software from your hard disk drive and you may not retain any 
copies of the Software for your own use.  This Software is for your PERSONAL, 
NON-COMMERCIAL, and NON-GOVERNMENTAL use only.


FURTHER RESTRICTIONS ON USE FOR SOFTWARE WITH PRINT 
FUNCTIONS.

If the Software provides you with the ability to print images containing Disney's 
copyrighted characters, this License only allows you to print the images on paper 
only and use them as printed by your computer's printer for your PERSONAL, 
NON-COMMERCIAL, and NON-GOVERNMENTAL use provided that you 
preserve all copyright notices that are included with the images as generated by 
the Software.  This means that you may, for example, use the Software to print 
invitations on your computer's printer to your own family party.  You may not, 
for example, use this Software to print invitations for functions or events 
sponsored by a business, charity, church, or educational institution.  Without 
limiting the foregoing, you may not use images generated by the Software in 
connection with any advertising or promotional materials, whether for profit or 
not for profit.  Use of images generated by the Software for any purpose not 
specifically allowed by this License is a violation of Disney's copyrights, 
trademarks and other proprietary rights and will result in the immediate 
termination of this License.


TERMINATION.   

This License is effective until terminated by either party.  You may terminate 
this License at any time by returning the Software to Disney or destroying the 
Software and all related documentation and all copies and installations thereof, 
whether made under the terms of this License or otherwise.  This License will 
terminate immediately without notice from Disney if you fail to comply with any 
provision of this License.  Upon termination, you must destroy or return to 
Disney the Software and related documentation and all copies thereof, whether 
made under the terms of this License or otherwise. 


LIMITED WARRANTY AND DISCLAIMER. 

DISNEY WARRANTS THE CD ROM ON WHICH THE SOFTWARE IS 
RECORDED TO BE FREE FROM DEFECTS IN MATERIALS AND 
WORKMANSHIP UNDER NORMAL USE FOR A PERIOD OF NINETY (90) 
DAYS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE AS EVIDENCED BY A COPY OF 
THE SALES RECEIPT OR PACKING SLIP.  DISNEY'S ENTIRE LIABILITY 
AND YOUR EXCLUSIVE REMEDY WILL BE REPLACEMENT OF THE 
DEFECTIVE CD ROM(S) OR REFUND OF THE PURCHASE PRICE (AT 
DISNEY'S ELECTION) UPON RETURN OF THE SOFTWARE TO DISNEY 
WITH A COPY OF YOUR PROOF OF PURCHASE.  DISNEY WILL HAVE 
NO RESPONSIBILITY TO REPLACE A CD ROM DAMAGED BY 
ACCIDENT, ABUSE OR MISAPPLICATION.  ANY IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS ON THE CD ROM, INCLUDING 
THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF 
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, 
ARE LIMITED IN DURATION TO NINETY (90) DAYS FROM THE DATE 
OF PURCHASE OR DELIVERY.  THIS WARRANTY GIVES YOU 
SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS, AND YOU MAY ALSO HAVE OTHER 
RIGHTS WHICH VARY FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.  YOU 
EXPRESSLY ACKNOWLEDGE AND AGREE THAT USE OF THE 
SOFTWARE IS AT YOUR SOLE RISK.  THE SOFTWARE AND RELATED 
DOCUMENTATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT 
WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND EITHER EXPRESS 
OR IMPLIED.  DISNEY EXPRESSLY DISCLAIMS ALL WARRANTIES 
AND/OR CONDITIONS, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, WITH RESPECT TO THE 
SOFTWARE AND RELATED DOCUMENTATION, INCLUDING, BUT 
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES AND/OR CONDITIONS 
OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  
DISNEY DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE FUNCTIONS CONTAINED 
IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR-FREE, OR 
THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED.  
FURTHERMORE, DISNEY DOES NOT WARRANT OR MAKE ANY 
REPRESENTATIONS REGARDING THE USE OR THE RESULTS OF THE 
USE OF THE SOFTWARE AND RELATED DOCUMENTATION IN TERMS 
OF THEIR CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, RELIABILITY, OR 
OTHERWISE. THE LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITIES DESCRIBED IN THIS 
SECTION ALSO APPLY TO THE THIRD PARTY SUPPLIERS OF 
MATERIALS USED IN THE SOFTWARE.  NO ORAL OR WRITTEN 
INFORMATION OR ADVICE BY DISNEY OR A DISNEY AUTHORIZED 
REPRESENTATIVE SHALL CREATE WARRANTIES AND/OR 
CONDITIONS OR IN ANY WAY INCREASE THE SCOPE OF THIS 
LIMITED WARRANTY. YOU (AND NOT DISNEY) ASSUME THE ENTIRE 
COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.  
SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED 
WARRANTIES, SO THE ABOVE EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO 
YOU.


LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  

Under no circumstances, including negligence, shall Disney be liable for any 
special or consequential damages that result from the use of, or the inability to 
use, the software or related documentation, even if Disney or a Disney 
authorized representative has been advised of the possibility of such damages.  
Some jurisdictions do not allow the limitation or exclusion of liability or 
incidental or consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may 
not apply to you.  In no event shall Disney's total liability to you for all damages, 
losses, and causes of action (whether in contract, tort (including negligence) or 
otherwise) exceed the amount paid by you for the Software.


GOVERNING LAW AND SEVERABILITY. 

This License shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of 
the State of California, without giving effect to any principles of conflicts of law.  
If any provision of this License shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason 
unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this License 
and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.  
This is the entire agreement between the parties relating to the subject matter 
herein and shall not be modified except in writing, signed by both parties.
